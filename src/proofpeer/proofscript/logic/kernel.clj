(ns proofpeer.proofscript.logic.kernel
  "A kernel for the simply typed lambda calculus together with ZFC set
theory. Formally: we allow terms to be rank-1 polymorphic and we allow
type-constructors provided that all their type arguments have kind *.

Additionally, all types are indexed by a context, which is used to associate
axioms and definitions with types, terms and theorems. The context is an
arbitrary value such that types with distinct context are taken to be
distinct.

All contexts are greater than the nil context and otherwise incomparable. See
the documentation for mk-ty-constr.

The nil context is reserved for the most logically secure parts of the
kernel. The only type-constructors in the nil context are:
  1) the nullary constructor for ZF sets
  2) the polymorphic function type constructor
The only axioms and inference rules are those for HOL + ZFC. The kernel does
not permit any new axioms in the nil context.

New axioms can be added into any other context according to whatever
conventions are adopted by the context implementation. For instance, a context
may wish to disallow overloaded constants and variadic type constructors."
